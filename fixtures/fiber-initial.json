Jonathan Blow, independent video game programmer/designer and former CSUA President, spoke in the Wozniak Lounge in Spring 2016. Jack Dorsey, CEO of Square and co-founder of Twitter, spoke in Sibley Auditorium in Fall 2013. Drew Houston, CEO of Dropbox, spoke in the Woz in Spring 2010.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>[1] Informational and skill-building events</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>We help provide resources for computer science students to find jobs and internships. We host info sessions with great companies and provide lots of skill-building events, such as interview workshops and industry sponsored hackathons. We also hold dinners with faculty (e.g. Brian Harvey in Spring 2013) and alumni.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>[2] Opportunities to build connections and meet students</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Come to CSUA events to meet your fellow CS students! Find study partners for your classes, work with other students on projects or hacks, and discuss topics like interview questions, CS research, good upper-division classes, and more!</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>[3] Free food at fun events</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>While we primarily serve as the entry point to the software industry, we know how to have fun too. We host hackathons with cool prizes, general meetings with free food, alumni BBQs, ice cream socials, intersocietal events, and more.</p>",

Committees</h2>\r\n\r\n<h3>The Politburo</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The Politburo shall consist of all elected officers of the CSUA. It shall hold at least three open meetings a semester while school is in regular session. The Politburo shall determine temporary policies of the CSUA. Politburo decisions may be overturned by a two-thirds vote of the general membership at a general meeting.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Other Committees</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Other committees may be created or dissolved at the direction of either the Politburo, or by a majority vote of the general membership at a General Meeting. Directorships or other non-politburo positions shall be appointed by the president and confirmed by the majority of the politburo.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Article VI. Election of Officers</h2>\r\n\r\n<h3>A. Time and Place of Elections</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Officers shall be selected each semester by a majority vote of the attending General Membership at a General Meeting held no less than two weeks before the last day of instruction, announced no less than one week in advance, and held at a time and place that is considered generally accessible as well in compliance with ASUC regulations concerning accessibility of ASUC sponsored activities.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>B. Procedure</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The chair shall appoint an election officer, who shall not vote or run for office. The election officer must be a member. Members shall be nominated until no more are willing and eligible. No person shall be nominated who is not willing to serve upon their election, and no person not present can be nominated for an office without his or her written consent being presented at the meeting. If only one candidate is in nomination voting may be done by acclamation. Otherwise voting shall be done by secret ballot of active members. A ballot that is blank or otherwise does not uniquely identify a nominated candidate shall not be counted.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If there is at any time a majority for a candidate, that candidate wins. If there is no majority and there are two candidates the election officer shall cast the deciding vote. If there is no majority and there are three candidates, the one with the fewest votes shall be eliminated. If there is a tie among those with the fewest votes the election officer shall select one to be eliminated.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If there are more than three candidates, three shall be selected to proceed to a runoff round as follows. Select as many candidates as possible for the runoff, starting from those with the highest vote totals, until it is impossible to proceed without selecting more than three or discriminating between candidates who received the same number of votes. If it is not possible to select any candidates in this way because there is a tie for first, the election officer shall cast a vote for one of the tied first-place candidates. If there are then fewer than three candidates selected for the runoff round, a new vote shall be held among those candidates not already chosen to select the remaining candidates.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Article VII. Removal and Replacement of Officers</h2>\r\n\r\n<h3>A. Removal</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>An officer may be removed from office in one of the following ways:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>In the event of extended unexplained absence of an officer, the office may be declared vacant by a majority of the remaining officers.</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>Any officer no longer qualified to hold office shall be removed.</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>A unanimous vote of the other officers in office may remove an officer from office.</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>In the event of a vacancy of an office the President will be responsible for ensuring that the obligations of that office are fulfilled until a replacement has been made.</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3>B. Replacement</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>In case of removal or resignation from office of one of the elected officers except the President, the President shall appoint a successor. All such appointments to office must be confirmed by a majority vote of the Politburo at the next announced Politburo meeting. As stated in Article IV, in the event the office of President is vacated for whatever reason, the Vice President of Technology shall either assume the office of President without need for confirmation and appoint a successor to be approved by a majority vote of a quorum of the Politburo, or, with the approval of a majority vote of the Politburo at the next announced Politburo meeting, appoint an eligible member to assume the office of President.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If both the offices of President and Vice President of Technology are vacated in such a way to obstruct the aforementioned order of succession, then the remaining officers, in the order of Vice President of Industry Relations, Secretary/Treasurer, External Events Coordinator, Internal Events Coordinator, and Outreach Chair, may either assume the office of President or, with the approval of the general membership, appoint a new President who will then fill any remaining open offices.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If all offices are made vacant, then the Faculty Advisor shall call and chair a general meeting to elect new officers.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Article VIII. Meetings</h2>\r\n\r\n<h3>A. Procedure</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>All meetings will run under Parliamentary procedure or some subset of the same. All questions, unless otherwise noted by this Constitution, shall require a majority vote. Only active members of the organization are eligible to vote. All meetings shall be held at reasonable places and times.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Members may vote and run by proxy.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>B. General Meetings</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>General Meetings shall be held three times a semester while school is in regular session, and shall be publicly announced no less than a week in advance.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>C. Politburo Meetings</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Politburo Meetings may be called by the President or by one-third of the Politburo. At least three meetings a semester while school is in regular session must be held open to the membership of the CSUA. Other meetings may be closed at the request of one-third of those members attending or in the event of disciplinary actions. In such a case, a listing of general topics discussed will be made available within one week after the meeting.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>D. Committee Meetings</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Committee meetings will be run under the same rules as the General Meetings. Meetings will be open to attendance by all members.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Article IX. Bylaws and Policies</h2>\r\n\r\n<h3>A. Bylaws</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Further guidelines pertaining to the operation of the CSUA not specifically set forth in the Constitution shall be contained in a set of publicly-available bylaws. Bylaws may be proposed by any active member of the CSUA, and must be approved by a majority vote of the Politburo.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>B. Policies</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Regulations pertaining to conduct of CSUA members in CSUA activities and in use of CSUA resources shall be contained in a set of publicly-available policies. Politburo members may formulate and implement interim policies in the execution of their duties, subject to later approval of a majority of the Politburo at the next Politburo meeting.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>C. Amendments to Bylaws and Policies</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Amendments to bylaws and policies may be proposed by any active member, and must be approved by a majority vote of the Politburo. Such amendments may be overturned by a two-thirds vote of the general membership at a general meeting.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Article X. Amendment</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Any amendment to this constitution must be approved by a two-thirds majority of a general meeting convened with at least one week prior prominent public notice of the intent to amend the constitution. All amendments, unless otherwise noted therein, become effective immediately upon adoption.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As a special exception, the officers of the CSUA may, for the sole purpose of bringing the constitution into compliance with ASUC and OSL requirements, amend the constitution by changing emphasized text. All such changes must be publicly announced within one week.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All amendments, additions or deletions to this document must be filed with the LEAD Center in 432 Eshleman Hall.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Article XI. Dissolution</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Dissolution of the Computer Science Undergraduate Association may be approved by a two-thirds majority of general meeting convened during instruction with at least two weeks notice of the intent to dissolve the CSUA. In the event of dissolution, to the extent permitted by campus and ASUC regulations, all remaining assets shall be donated to a campus computing organization which allows free access to all University of California at Berkeley students.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If the organization is ASUC or GA Sponsored, all unspent ASUC funds shall return to the ASUC; all Graduate Assembly funds shall return to the Graduate Assembly. If the organization is defunct for five (5) or more years, any privately obtained funds (including any funds left in miscellaneous accounts) shall be donated to the ASUC. In the event that the designated nonprofit organization no longer exists or has ceased to be a nonprofit, then the unspent funds shall be donated to the ASUC.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Last modified Feb 21, 2018</p>",
