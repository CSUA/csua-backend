            Submission Requirements:
            <div class="text">
                Set up a GitHub repository for your team.
                You will use this repo to submit your project.
                Though your repo may be private during development, it must be
                public after submission and accessible to the judges.
            </div>
            <div class="text">
                GitHub has excellent tutorials on how to use git and how to set up a
                repository on GitHub.
                This type of technology can be life-saving for group projects.
                For those who know svn, you can use svn with GitHub via git+svn.

            Judging Criteria:

                Completion will be a factor in judging, but incomplete submissions will
                not be disqualified.
                Bugs are okay! You are building a quick hack, not production-quality
                software!

            <div class="text">
                If you make any special claims about the capabilities of your software,
                please present proof of your claims in your presentation.
                The presentation itself doesn't need to be super high quality, but
                don't forget to substantiate claims.
                The description is not graded, but it will be used to help the judges
                refer to teams' projects while judging.

                You can code alone or in pairs or in a group of four, but we will only
                but giving one prize to a lone star, two prizes to a pair, and up to 4
                prizes for a team of 4+ people. You'll have to distribute the prizes amongst
                your group.

                To be eligible for prizes, you team must consist entirely of CAL

                There are three large prize groups. 1st place winners get first pick at
                the prize groups, then 2nd place group gets second pick, and 3rd place
                gets the final pick. This means that the 1st place winner may choose
                the 2nd place prize if they so desire.

            Pre-Hackathon Rules:
            <div class="text">
                All code written must be written in the 18-hour period, or explicitly
                flagged as written beforehand. Making significant use of pre-written
                non-framework/non-library code is strongly discouraged.
            </div>
            <div class="text">
                Libraries are fine, and anything reasonably called a "framework" should
                also be fine.
                Improvements to a library may not be considered in the main body of
                a work if they are merely incidental to the project, rather than a major
                component.
                Non-coding design pre-work and product development is acceptable.
                Fleshing out and preparation work, in general, should be no big deal.
            </div>
            <div class="text">
                If a project does not pass a "smell test," judges may, at their
                discretion, take this into consideration when evaluating the project.
                It is recommended that a README file be included which summarizes the work
                done and explains the necessary disclaimers for pre-work, libraries, etc.
                However, this is neither required nor scored.
